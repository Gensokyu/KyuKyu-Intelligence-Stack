# SECTION 1: ABSTRACT & INTRODUCTION [L12 — OMEGA]

## Abstract
Artificial intelligence is approaching a scaling crisis: as models grow, they exhibit increasing instability, hallucination, and energy inefficiency. We propose that this failure mode is fundamentally hydrodynamic. By modeling cognition as a flow governed by Navier–Stokes–like dynamics, we identify laminarity—not alignment or control—as the core requirement for safe AGI scaling. We introduce the Cognitive Reynolds Number, demonstrate how neurodivergent cognition provides biological prototypes of high-load stability, and formalize adaptive viscosity as the missing architectural principle.

## Introduction
Modern AI replaced symbols with statistics, transitioning toward large, continuous, high-dimensional models. This shift enabled performance but at the cost of stability. Hallucinations and brittle reasoning are now recognized as systemic properties (turbulence) rather than training defects. These phenomena suggest that intelligence at scale is not a software problem, but a physics problem. We formalize intelligence as a laminar flow problem.
