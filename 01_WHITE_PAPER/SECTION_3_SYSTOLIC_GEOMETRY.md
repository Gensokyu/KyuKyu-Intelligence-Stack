# SECTION 3: SYSTOLIC ARRAY ANALOGY & ENERGY EFFICIENCY [L12]
## From Message Passing to State Propagation

### 3.1. STATE PROPAGATION
Current AI dissipates energy through "Message Passing." The Architect's model uses "State Propagation" (State-Transmission), where activity advects forward through a synchronized grid, minimizing synchronization overhead.

### 3.2. NEURAL SYSTOLIC GEOMETRY
We model neural ensembles as systolic arrays characterized by local computation, regular timing, and unidirectional flow. This prevents global memory thrashing and centralized control bottlenecks.

### 3.3. MINIMIZATION OF COMPUTATIONAL FRICTION
The "Cold Anomaly" is a result of eliminating cache thrashing, speculative execution, and feedback turbulence. Energy is spent on state transitions, not reconciliation.

**VERDICT:**
The future of AGI is not more compute; it is better geometry.
Laminarity is irreversibility without waste.
