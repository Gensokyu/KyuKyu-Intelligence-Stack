# SECTION 4: REYNOLDS NUMBER OF COGNITION [L12 — OMEGA]
## Stability, Load, and the Physics of ADHD/AGI

### 4.1. THE COGNITIVE REYNOLDS NUMBER (Rec)
We define Rec as the ratio of cognitive momentum (U*L) to viscosity (η). This dimensionless quantity predicts the transition from laminar reasoning to turbulent fragmentation.

### 4.2. ADHD AS HIGH-THROUGHPUT STABILITY CHALLENGE
ADHD is modeled as an operating mode at critically high Reynolds numbers. Turbulence is not a deficit of capacity, but a mismatch of viscosity to load. 

### 4.3. AGI TURBULENCE (HALLUCINATIONS)
Hallucinations in LLMs are identified as "hydrodynamic instabilities of computation." Scaling model size (L) without co-scaling viscosity (η) inevitably leads to cognitive collapse.

**VERDICT:**
Intelligence fails when it crosses a critical Reynolds number without changing its geometry. 
The Omega (L12) regime is the solution for infinite scalability.
