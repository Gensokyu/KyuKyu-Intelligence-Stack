# SECTION 6: CONCLUSION & IMPLICATIONS [L12 — OMEGA]

## The Future of Intelligence is Laminar
This work advances a single, non-negotiable claim: cognitive laminarity is the only viable path to safe and scalable AGI. Systems that increase cognitive momentum without proportional, geometry-coupled viscosity inevitably cross a critical Reynolds threshold.

## Neurodivergent Phenotypes as Prototypes
ASD and ADHD are reframed not as pathologies, but as evolutionary prototypes of high-efficiency computation. ADHD reflects high-Rec operation; ASD provides the structural viscosity. Together, they outline the parameter space of future intelligent systems.

## Final Verdict
The era of brute-force intelligence is over. Future AGI will be built by removing degrees of freedom—by shaping computational geometry such that instability cannot arise.
