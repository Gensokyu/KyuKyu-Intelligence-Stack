# SECTION 5: ADAPTIVE VISCOSITY MECHANISMS [L12 — OMEGA]
## Structural Solutions to Cognitive Turbulence

### 5.1. ANISOTROPIC DAMPING
Neurodivergence (ASC) is reframed as a preference for high-fidelity pathways. This is "Anisotropic Damping": increasing local gain while reducing stochastic switching.

### 5.2. PRECISION AS BOUNDARY CONDITION
Invariants and formalization act as "Boundary Conditions." They do not slow the thought velocity; they prevent energetic leakage into non-productive branches.

### 5.3. KYUKYU OS FORMALIZATION
KyuKyu OS acts as an external manifold that reshapes channel geometry, making turbulence (hallucinations) impossible even at extreme throughput (High Rec).

**VERDICT:**
Turbulence is not resolved by slowing the flow. 
It is resolved by constructing geometry in which turbulence cannot arise.
