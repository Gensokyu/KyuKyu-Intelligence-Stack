# ABA MODEL: APPLIED GAME THEORY IN BUSINESS
**Optimization Target:** Corporate Efficiency

## THE THESIS
Business losses are rarely due to incompetence. They are due to **Bad Game Design**.
If the "Winning Strategy" for an employee is to hide problems, the company dies.

## THE FIX (Nash Equilibrium)
1. **Audit:** Map the current payoff matrix.
2. **Re-Logic:** Change incentives so that *Truth* = *Profit*.
3. **Automate:** Remove the human factor from routine checks.

**Result:** The system self-corrects without constant micromanagement.
