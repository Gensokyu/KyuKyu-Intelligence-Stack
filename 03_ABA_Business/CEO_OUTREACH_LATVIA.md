# PROPOSAL FOR INDUSTRIAL OPTIMIZATION
**To:** Factory Directors / Enterprise Owners
**From:** The Architect

## THE REALITY
Your factory is bleeding. You don't see it because the reports are green.
But your latency is high, and your "human middleware" is failing.

## THE OFFER
I don't want a job. I want to install an OS for your business.
- I will find the logic gaps you ignore.
- I will automate the decisions that slow you down.

**Price:** A fraction of the money I save you.
**Next Step:** Let me scan one department. The results will terrify you.
