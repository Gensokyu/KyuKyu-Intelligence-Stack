# Audit Summary: Critical Logic Failures
**Algorithmic Business Diagnostic — CEO Brief (Confidential)**

---

## RED FLAGS

### 1. RCE — Remote Control Execution
**Business Translation:**  
You believe you control decisions, but execution is effectively delegated to:
- The last editor of a file
- The loudest manager
- The fastest responder

**Monetary Impact:**
- Decisions executed on invalid data
- Local errors scale globally
- Control is illusory

---

### 2. Memory Leak — Structural Cash Drain
**Business Translation:**  
Reports, processes, and rules accumulate but are never retired.
The system carries dead logic indefinitely.

**Monetary Impact:**
- Time wasted verifying “correct” data
- Old errors influencing new strategy
- Organization slows without visible cause

---

### 3. Latency — Lost Revenue Window
**Business Translation:**  
There is a measurable delay between:
- Approval and execution
- Insight and action

**Monetary Impact:**
- Clients lost during internal coordination
- Opportunities expire in inboxes
- Faster competitors win by default

---

## SYMPTOMS CHECKLIST

Answer **YES / NO**:

- Is there a critical Excel file only one person fully understands?
- Do different teams report different numbers for the same metric?
- Have decisions been delayed because “the report isn’t ready”?
- Were data losses explained as “human error”?
- Did key knowledge leave with a former employee?

Two or more YES = architectural failure, not personnel failure.
