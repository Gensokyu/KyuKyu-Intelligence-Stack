# ARCHITECTURAL BLIND SPOT REPORT
**Class:** Logic Failure / System Philosophy
**Severity:** Critical (Velocity Loss)

## 1. THE LENS (PREMISE)
This is not a vulnerability report. This is a proof that the current architecture interprets reality incorrectly.

## 2. STRUCTURE OF FAILURE
### A. Observation (Expected Behavior)
[Describe what the system claims to do logic-wise]

### B. The Glitch (Observed Reality)
[Describe the contradiction you found]

### C. Root Logic Failure
[The assumption that breaks everything. Why did the engineers miss this?]

## 3. BLAST RADIUS
Not just security. This causes **Velocity Loss** across the ecosystem.

## 4. PROPOSAL
Do not patch the hole. Rewrite the incentive logic.
