# ARCHITECTURAL BLIND SPOT REPORT
**Class:** Logic Failure / System Philosophy
**Severity:** Critical (Velocity Loss)

## 1. THE LENS (PREMISE)
This is not a vulnerability report. This is a proof that your architecture thinks incorrectly.

## 2. STRUCTURE OF FAILURE
### A. Observation
[What should be impossible in a perfect system]

### B. Contradiction
[Why it happens anyway - The Glitch]

### C. Root Logic Failure
[The assumption that breaks everything]

## 3. BLAST RADIUS
Not just security. This causes **Velocity Loss** across the entire Google ecosystem.

## 4. FUTURE COST
At Google scale, this "small" logic error compounds into massive technical debt.

---
**Proposal:** Do not patch the hole. Rewrite the logic.
