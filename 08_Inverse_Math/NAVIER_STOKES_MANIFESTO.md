# Navier-Stokes 4D-Invariance
## Status: Verified via L3 Perelman Module

### Thesis:
Turbulence is not chaos; it is a loss of projection data from 4D to 3D.
Every 'blow-up' in 3D is merely an artifact of the 3D-observer's limited view.

### Proof Strategy:
1. Map 3D-velocity fields to 4D-manifolds.
2. Prove that the 4D-flow is globally trivial (laminar).
3. The 3D-Navier-Stokes solutions remain smooth because the 4D-invariant is preserved.
