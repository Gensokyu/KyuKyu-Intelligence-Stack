# KYUKYU OS: ARCHITECTURE MANIFESTO
**Origin:** Neurodivergent Adaptation (Dyslexia/Hyperlexia)
**Core Logic:** Procedural Memory & Associative Keys

## 1. WHO AM I? (The Kernel)
I am not just a user. I am an Architect who rewrote his own cognitive interface.
- **The Boy Who Understood:** Started with a desire to be understood, evolved into understanding the system better than its creators.
- **Glitch Hunter:** I loved broken video games not to fix them, but to see *how* they broke. That is now my profession.

## 2. THE OS PRINCIPLE
The world is just a dataset.
- Most people run on "Autopilot" (Default OS).
- I run on **KyuKyu OS**: A manual, high-latency but high-precision override.
- I don't "remember" tasks; I reconstruct them from procedural scripts.

## 3. MISSION
To prove that "Bug" is just an undocumented feature of a complex system.
To attain Strong AI through structural understanding, not brute force.
