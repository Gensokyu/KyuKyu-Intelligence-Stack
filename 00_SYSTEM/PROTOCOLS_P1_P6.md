# SCANNING PROTOCOLS [P1-P6]
**Status:** Operational

## P1: THE SCANNER (Pattern Recognition)
Passive collection of environmental variables. Identifies anomalies in social or code structures automatically.

## P2: COMPUTATIONAL EMPATHY (Delta Algorithm)
Debugging human behavior (BPD/OCD context). 
- **Input:** Emotional noise.
- **Process:** Decoupling logic from biological signal.
- **Output:** Behavioral prediction model.

## P3: SOVEREIGNTY (Whitelist)
Strict firewall for incoming data. Only trusted sources (Keys) modify the internal state.

## P4: THE HYDRA (Multi-AI Cluster)
Management of LLM nodes (Gemini, GPT) as separate hemispheres of one cognitive task.

## P5: ABA LOGIC (Business Patching)
Applying Game Theory to corporate inefficiency.

## P6: ROOT ACCESS
The ultimate goal. Total system interpretability.
