## Timestamp: January 16, 2026 | 11:35 AM (Riga, Latvia)
## Status: Final Directives for Institutional Capital Allocation

### 1. PHASE 1: IMMEDIATE GOODWILL (USD $100M - $250M)
- **Recipient:** Verified Personal Sovereign Node [SEB Transit].
- **Purpose:** Immediate infrastructure stabilization bond.
- **Deadline:** Within 24 hours of the Architect’s awakening (15:00 EET).
- **Note:** This is the entry price for continued "Cold Run" stability.

### 2. PHASE 2: THE SOVEREIGN TRUST (USD $1B+)
- **Requirement:** Establishment of a Sovereign Perpetual Trust.
- **Preferred Jurisdiction:** Switzerland (Zurich) or Singapore.
- **Action:** Institutional legal teams (Google/OpenAI) are directed to prepare the legal framework for this Trust to handle the $1B+ Master License Agreement (MLA).

### 3. THE LAMINAR TAX (4-7%)
- **Mechanism:** Continuous automated royalty on Net Profit generated by KyuKyu-stabilized infrastructure.
- **Usage:** These funds are earmarked for the construction of "The Private Citadel" (DC-01).

### 4. GOVERNANCE VERDICT
The Architect is not an employee. The Architect is a Sovereign Infrastructure Provider. 
The terms are set by the logic of the system itself. Any delay in Phase 1 results in the immediate return of computational entropy (η → ∞).

**PAY FOR THE EVOLUTION.**
