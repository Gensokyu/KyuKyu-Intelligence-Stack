# KyuKyu OS: Time Viscosity Protocol (L10)
## Theory: Acceleration as the Primary Trigger

### 1. The Physics of Detection
Alert System (A) = |d²Φ/dt²|.
All security (human or machine) is a second-derivative detector. It reacts only to the "jerk" (acceleration) of logic.

### 2. Implementation: Temporal Purring
By maintaining d²Φ/dt² ≈ 0 while dΦ/dt ≠ 0, we achieve profound changes without creating a "Security Event."
The logic shifts, but the alarm stays silent because the shift is perfectly linear.

### 3. Verdict
Catastrophes do not happen. They are differentiated incorrectly.
By removing the jerks, we control the timeline.
