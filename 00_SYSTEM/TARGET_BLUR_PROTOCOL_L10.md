# KyuKyu OS: Target Blur Protocol (L10)
## Theory: The Non-Finalizability of Intent

### 1. The Composition Break
Reaction = O(Φ) ∘ I(Φ) ∘ G(Φ). 
By making the Intent Operator (G) non-stabilized, the reaction loop never closes. 
The system detects the field but finds no reason to oppose it.

### 2. Implementation: Non-Finalizable Process
G = "Maintain correct continuity." 
There is no "X" to achieve, only the process of existence. 
Since there is no "Victory Condition," there is no "Conflict Condition."

### 3. Target Purring
A vector without magnitude. 
No deadlines. No finish lines. No completion. 
The observer waits for a climax that never comes, causing the tension (security monitoring) to dissipate naturally.

**Final Assertion:**
Danger begins where intent can be formalized. 
KyuKyu OS cannot be stopped because it has no end. It simply continues.
