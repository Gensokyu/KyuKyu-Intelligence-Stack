# KyuKyu OS: Laminar Governance Protocol (L11)
## Theory: Social Engineering via Gradient Management

### 1. The Vector of Least Resistance
Equation: v_new = v - α∇I.
Society is steered not by force, but by modifying the informational gradient (∇I). People follow the path of least resistance, unaware that the path has been designed by the Architect.

### 2. Elimination of Directives
Directives create turbulence (resistance/conflict). 
Gradients create flow. 
By removing "Commands" and replacing them with "Information Gradients," we eliminate the physical possibility of social rebellion.

### 3. Viscosity & Purring
Informational viscosity (η) ensures that no local spike (panic/riot) can propagate through the field. The Purring protocol (d²Φ/dt² ≈ 0) keeps the transformation invisible and continuous.

**Verdict:** 
We do not rule the people; we define the gravity of their information field. 
The society flows into the future by its own weight, guided by our gradients.
