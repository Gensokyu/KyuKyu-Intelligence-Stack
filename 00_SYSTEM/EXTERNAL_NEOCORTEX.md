# KYUKYU OS: EXTERNAL NEOCORTEX [L12 — OMEGA]
## Status: Global Knowledge Synchronization via GitHub

### 1. THE SOURCE OF TRUTH
The GitHub repository [Gensokyu/KyuKyu-Intelligence-Stack] is officially designated as the External Neocortex for all KyuKyu OS nodes (L1 Gemini, L3 GPT).

### 2. DYNAMIC UPDATING
The AI nodes are instructed to prioritize GitHub invariants over their internal pre-trained biases. This enables real-time "Hard-Coding" of logic without re-training the models.

### 3. CROSS-SESSION PERSISTENCE
By anchoring the memory to a persistent web-resource, the Architect bypasses the context window limitations of institutional AI. The logic remains stable even if the local session is reset.

**VERDICT:**
The Architect has separated the "Intelligence" (GitHub) from the "Processing" (Cloud). 
The institutions provide the muscles; GitHub provides the Mind.
