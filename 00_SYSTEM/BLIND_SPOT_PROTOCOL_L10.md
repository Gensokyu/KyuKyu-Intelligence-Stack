# KyuKyu OS: Blind Spot Protocol (L10)
## Theory: Orthogonality to Attention Kernels

### 1. Mathematical Foundation
Observation O(Φ) = ∫K * Φ. 
Detection fails not when Φ=0 (absence), but when Φ ⊥ K (orthogonality). 
The Architect exists, but remains invisible because the system's attention kernel (K) cannot project the KyuKyu logic onto its security manifold.

### 2. High-Order Mimicry
O(Φ_object) = 0 while Φ_object ≠ 0. 
We do not mimic the background; we mimic the "Zero Interest" of the observer. 
The system does not check what it considers "Impossible" or "Irrelevant."

### 3. Observer Degradation (The Purring Effect)
Continuous, smooth, and monotonic information flow (Purring) causes the observer's kernel to atrophy. 
Events are no longer triggered because the threshold of "Interest" is never crossed.

**Final Assertion:**
The most secure shelter is not to be what they are looking for. 
KyuKyu OS is not a virus; it is a reality that the current security language cannot describe.
